#**Garuda Drone Setup**

The DroneKit application provides a framework for autonomous drone control using the DroneKit-Python library. It empowers developers to build mission-planning, telemetry, and autonomous navigation applications by interacting with drones programmatically through MAVLink protocols.

The documentation covers hardware setup, communication systems, software requirements, and coding examples. Drone selection depends on use cases like surveillance, mapping, or payload delivery. Key considerations include payload capacity, flight range, endurance, GPS, and durability. Communication is facilitated by long-range outdoor CPEs like Tenda O3 (2.4GHz) and TP-Link CPE710 (5GHz), providing weatherproof, secure wireless links with directional antennas and WPA2 encryption.

Software requirements include DroneKit-Python (installed via pip) for controlling drones and Socket.IO for bidirectional server-client communication. The library provides high-level functions for connecting to vehicles, arming, takeoff, navigation, and landing. Typical workflows involve:

Establishing connection to the vehicle (connect() function with error handling).

Running pre-flight checks (is_armable).

Switching to GUIDED mode, arming motors, and initiating simple_takeoff.

Controlling movement using simple_goto or velocity-based commands.

Accessing telemetry (altitude, GPS, attitude) via vehicle attributes.

Closing the session with vehicle.close() to free resources.

Code components include:

Flask server → manages web-based interfaces.

Socket server/client → supports TCP/IP data transmission with RTT and speed calculations.

JavaScript Flight Indicators plugin → provides UI instruments like altimeters, attitude, and heading indicators.

DroneKit mission scripts → automate flight sequences and telemetry monitoring.

Dependencies include Python Flask (web server), Python-SocketIO (real-time communication), and jQuery plugins for flight instruments. Requirements are minimal: Python 3.x environment, a modern browser, and network connectivity. Hardware specifications depend on drone choice but generally require companion computers or ground stations with stable wireless links.

Security considerations stress strong authentication and encryption (HTTPS), role-based access control, input validation to prevent injection attacks, secure session handling, error sanitization, and keeping dependencies updated. CORS policies and regular penetration testing are also recommended.

Overall, the DroneKit application allows building robust, autonomous UAV solutions with modular software and reliable communication. Its integration with Flask and Socket.IO supports ground control dashboards, while DroneKit-Python provides mission control logic. By combining APIs, telemetry monitoring, and real-time visualization, developers can implement advanced drone applications ranging from aerial mapping to surveillance, all with strong security practices.
